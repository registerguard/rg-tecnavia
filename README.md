## What's this all about?

[The Register-Guard][1] (my current place of employment) recently launched an ["e-Edition" version of the newspaper][2] powered by [Tecnavia's media solutions][3].

This Github repository contains all of the source files used to create [this online e-Edition "skin"][4].

## Why did you put this stuff on Github?

Tecnavia requires up to 27 icons for the online e-Edition interface and they do not provide a default skin to get you started.

For us, creating the skin from scratch was moderately time consuming.

We decided to put our source files on Github for others, who are just getting started with Tecnavia e-Edition, to use as a starting point for their own skin.

## What's the catch?

Not much.

There's just a few stipulations if you decide to use our source files:

 1. Use of The Register-Guard logo(s) is prohibited.
 2. [Fork this repo][5], modify it to suit your needs, and store the final version on Github (via the forked repo) for others to fork for their Tecnavia e-Edition projects.

That's it!

### Notes:

  * The PSD file uses Helvetica Neue Bold for the icon labels.
  * Photoshop CS5+ required to open e-edition.v5.slice.psd
